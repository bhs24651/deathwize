COMPATIBILITY

This program is compatible with Windows 7 and later versions.
Admin privileges are recommended, but not necessary to run the
program.

It is normal for the program to show up as "suspicious" when you 
run it for the first time. 
This is because it is not signed with a certificate. You can safely
ignore this warning and run the program.

If you find that you cannot access the web even after enabling
DeathWize, it is most likely that your administrator has enabled
a filtering server on your network. If that is the case, use
a VPN to help with the effectiveness of DeathWize.
