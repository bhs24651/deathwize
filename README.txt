========================================================

WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
DeathWize is a Windows-based utility designed to monitor and manage Google Chrome extension processes.

Its primary use case is to help users regain control over their web browsing experience in environments where browser extensions (such as filtering or monitoring tools) interfere with normal browsing.

This software is intended for **educational, administrative, or personal use only**.

KEY FEATURES
------------
- Detects and terminates Chrome extension subprocesses (based on command-line arguments).
- Protects system resources by reducing CPU usage through smart scan intervals.
- Avoids repeatedly targeting system processes through adaptive allowlisting.
- Does not install any files or modify system settings.

USAGE NOTES
-----------
This application:
- Does **not** persist after shutdown or reboot.
- Does **not** alter system files, registry entries, or browser configuration.
- Is designed to be used manually and visibly by the user.
- Requires manual execution by a consenting user.

SECURITY AND PRIVACY
--------------------
DeathWize does not:
- Transmit or collect any data.
- Run in the background or as a system service.
- Install drivers or kernel components.

It is a **clean, open, and visible executable** that operates under the logged-in user's permissions only.

ANTI-MALWARE STATEMENT
